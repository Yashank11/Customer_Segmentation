Project Overview: Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project involves analyzing and segmenting customers using a dataset that contains various demographic and behavioral features. The objective is to classify customers into different segments to help businesses understand their customer base better and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. Here's a summary of the key steps and methodologies used in the project:

Data Understanding
The dataset includes the following columns:

ID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Male or Female
Ever_Married: Yes or No
Age: Age of the customer
Graduated: Yes or No
Profession: Type of profession
Work_Experience: Number of years of work experience
Spending_Score: Spending score (Low, Average, High)
Family_Size: Number of family members
Category: A categorical variable (Cat_1 to Cat_7)
Segmentation: Target variable (A, B, C, D)
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Missing values in columns were filled using the mode (most frequent value).
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables were encoded into numerical values for model training.
Outlier Detection: Outliers in the Age column were identified and noted.
Dropping Unnecessary Columns: The ID column was dropped as it does not contribute to the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization: Various plots were created to understand the distribution of different features such as age, profession, and spending score.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap was used to visualize correlations between features.
Model Building
Several machine learning models were employed to classify the customers into different segments:

Logistic Regression

Achieved an accuracy of around 38% on the test set.
Confusion matrix and classification report were used to evaluate performance.
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

Hyperparameter tuning was performed to find the best number of neighbors.
Achieved a test accuracy of around 45%.
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Hyperparameter tuning was done to select the best kernel and regularization parameter.
Achieved a test accuracy of approximately 47%.
Decision Tree

Hyperparameter tuning was done to choose the best criterion.
Achieved high training accuracy but relatively lower test accuracy, indicating overfitting.
Random Forest

Tuning and modeling were performed but specific results were not detailed in the provided information.
Model Evaluation
Accuracy: The accuracy scores for each model were calculated on both training and test sets.
Cross-Validation: Cross-validation was used to ensure the models' robustness.
Confusion Matrix: Provided a detailed view of true vs. predicted classifications for each segment.
Classification Report: Included precision, recall, and f1-score for each segment.
Key Findings
The SVM model showed the best performance with a test accuracy of 47%.
Most models struggled to accurately classify all segments, indicating the need for further feature engineering or more sophisticated models.
Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms for customer segmentation. While the SVM model showed the highest accuracy, the overall performance suggests room for improvement. Future work could involve exploring more advanced techniques, such as ensemble methods or deep learning, and additional feature engineering to enhance model accuracy and robustness.
